This is the website I maintained while acting as event organizer for Missouri State's ACM club.

Although the website is no longer hosted at mostateacm.org , the presentations are still here to download.

|Title/Link|Presenter|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|[Introduction to Git](./presentations/450-git.pdf)|Cole Lawrence|This is a presentation I gave to our Software Development course who were just then learning about how Git worked. The presentation is mostly images since I prefer not to read off slides.|
|[Sept 3rd, Git Workshop](./presentations/mostateacm-workshop-2015-09-03.pdf)|Cole Lawrence|This is a second presentation I gave introducing the importance of Git to our club. Unfortunately, before I started pushing for git usage, our CSC department had little emphasis on git. I invited Nicholas Jaross, software engineer for O'Reilly Auto Parts, to help present this, which was really fun.|
|[Oct 1st, "Standing Out" Technical Resumé Workshop](./presentations/mostateacm-workshop-2015-10-01.pdf)|Autumn Rodden and Nicholas Jaross|I invited Autumn Rodden, technical recruiter for O'Reilly Auto Parts, to give our club a breakdown of what she looks for with Nicholas Jaross from resumés for their development positions. She goes over each part of the resumé and which parts are important to emphasize.|
|[Oct 15th, "Web Development Now" Workshop](./presentations/mostateacm-workshop-2015-10-15.pdf)|Cole Lawrence|I gave this presentation to our club to help them get a high level view of how web programming is different than application programming. I focused on how session needs to be managed and basic networking. Our program only had a single required course which taught some web development, where students learned some HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Given how important web development was at the time, and where jobs were going, I wanted to help students understand it a little better.|
|[Oct 29th, "A Day in the (Project) Life(cycle)" Workshop](./presentations/mostateacm-workshop-2015-10-29.pdf)|Maranda Provance of [Mostly Serious](https://mostlyserious.io)|I invited Maranda to give our ACM group some insight on the way a project is estimated and built out for a client, from the perspective of the project management level. Through this presentation, students learned more about the other moving parts at a company which is not a part of our curriculum. This was a fantastic presentation, and it has timeless value.|
